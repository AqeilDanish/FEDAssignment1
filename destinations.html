                    Malaysia is a country of contrasts, sliced in half by the South China Sea. On one side, colonial treasure troves, 
                    tropical islands, and modern cityscapes captivate; while in Borneo, rain forests and wild animals dominate the landscape. 
                    Malaysia is crowned by its sleek capital, Kuala Lumpur, where the Petronas Twin Towers, the Batu Caves, and enticing street food reign supreme.
